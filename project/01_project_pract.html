                B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering (CSE) with Specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine
                Learning is a course featured by Sri Sai College of Engineering & Technology which helps its students to
                gain a practical understanding of various Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
                functions and grows individual networks through cross-functional relationships. The major focus of the
                programme is to equip the students who wish to acquire the ability to design intelligent solutions to
                real-time problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                SSGI has developed this course with the help of industry experts keeping in mind the advancement and
                increased demand of the use of AI and ML in today's industries. SSGI has joined hands with IBM to
                develop this advanced curriculum to focus on developing the critical understanding of Linear Algebra and
                Statistics that are the foundation of AI and ML concepts. This programme discusses artificial
                intelligence methods based on different fields like neural networks, signal processing and data mining,
                etc.

                <p>
                    Even as technology changes to keep up with the needs of a changing world, Computer Science programs
                    are often out-of-date, and in some cases, obsolete. Students thus need significant training after
                    employment before they can be deployed and contribute to the employer business. IBM ICE provides
                    cutting-tech technological knowledge and Industry-specific training, with a state-of-the-art
                    delivery model and the students are provided with the requisite knowledge and skills to thrive in a
